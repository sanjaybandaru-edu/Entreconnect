# **Balanced Scorecard: A Comprehensive Tool for Performance Management**

## **What is a Balanced Scorecard?**
The **Balanced Scorecard (BSC)** is a strategic management tool used to measure an organizationâ€™s performance across four key perspectives:
1. **Financial**
2. **Customer**
3. **Internal Processes**
4. **Learning and Growth**

Unlike traditional methods that focus solely on financial results, the BSC provides a more holistic view of performance by considering non-financial factors critical to long-term success.
