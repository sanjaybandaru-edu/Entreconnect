## **Breaking Down the Four Components**

### **1. Strengths (Internal Factors)**
   - **What it means**: Strengths are what you or your business do well, the advantages you have over others.
   - **Examples**:
     - A company known for high-quality products (e.g., Apple’s innovative design).
     - A team with excellent customer service skills.
     - Unique technology or patents.
   - **How to identify**:
     - What resources or capabilities make you stand out?
     - What do customers or peers praise about you?

   **Example in Action**:  
   Imagine a small bakery that is famous in the neighborhood for its fresh, handmade pastries. The bakery’s strength is its loyal local customer base and high-quality, unique recipes.

### **2. Weaknesses (Internal Factors)**
   - **What it means**: Weaknesses are areas where you or your business may be lacking or underperforming.
   - **Examples**:
     - A lack of online presence in today’s digital world.
     - High production costs compared to competitors.
     - Limited expertise in certain areas.
   - **How to identify**:
     - What do customers complain about?
     - What are competitors doing better?

   **Example in Action**:  
   The same bakery struggles with slow service during busy times due to insufficient staff. This is a weakness that could lead to customer dissatisfaction.

### **3. Opportunities (External Factors)**
   - **What it means**: Opportunities are external factors that can be leveraged for growth or improvement.
   - **Examples**:
     - Rising demand for healthier food options (trend-driven opportunities).
     - Expansion into new markets or locations.
     - Advancements in technology that reduce costs.
   - **How to identify**:
     - What trends or changes in the market can you take advantage of?
     - Are there unmet needs your business could fulfill?

   **Example in Action**:  
   The bakery notices an increasing trend in gluten-free diets. Offering gluten-free pastries could attract a new customer base.

### **4. Threats (External Factors)**
   - **What it means**: Threats are external challenges or risks that could negatively impact you or your business.
   - **Examples**:
     - Competitors opening new stores nearby.
     - Rising ingredient prices or supply chain disruptions.
     - Changes in regulations or laws.
   - **How to identify**:
     - What external factors could harm your business or project?
     - Are there economic, technological, or competitive risks?

   **Example in Action**:  
   A large bakery chain opens a new branch in the same area, offering cheaper products. This could divert some of the local bakery's customers.
