## **Why Use Porter’s Five Forces?**
- To identify factors affecting profitability in an industry.
- To develop strategies that strengthen competitive advantages.
- To understand industry dynamics before entering a new market or launching a product.

## **The Five Forces Explained**

### **1. Threat of New Entrants**
   - **What it means**: The risk of new competitors entering the industry and disrupting the market.
   - **Key Factors to Consider**:
     - Barriers to entry (e.g., high startup costs, strict regulations).
     - Brand loyalty of existing players.
     - Economies of scale achieved by established businesses.
   - **Examples**:
     - **Low Threat**: The airline industry, where high capital investment and regulatory hurdles discourage new entrants.
     - **High Threat**: The food delivery market, where low startup costs make it easy for new players to enter.

### **2. Bargaining Power of Suppliers**
   - **What it means**: The influence suppliers have on the prices, quality, and availability of inputs.
   - **Key Factors to Consider**:
     - Number of suppliers available.
     - Uniqueness of the supplier's product or service.
     - Switching costs for the business.
   - **Examples**:
     - **High Power**: Tech companies relying on specialized semiconductor manufacturers.
     - **Low Power**: Restaurants sourcing generic food ingredients from numerous suppliers.

---

### **3. Bargaining Power of Buyers**
   - **What it means**: The ability of customers to drive prices down or demand better quality/service.
   - **Key Factors to Consider**:
     - Availability of alternatives.
     - Sensitivity to price changes.
     - Volume of purchase (bulk buyers have more power).
   - **Examples**:
     - **High Power**: Large retail chains negotiating with small suppliers for lower prices.
     - **Low Power**: Individual consumers buying luxury goods with limited alternatives.

---

### **4. Threat of Substitute Products or Services**
   - **What it means**: The likelihood of customers switching to a different product or service that meets the same need.
   - **Key Factors to Consider**:
     - Availability of substitutes.
     - Price-performance trade-off of substitutes.
   - **Examples**:
     - **High Threat**: Coffee shops face competition from instant coffee products and energy drinks.
     - **Low Threat**: Pharmaceuticals with patented, life-saving drugs have few substitutes.

---

### **5. Industry Rivalry**
   - **What it means**: The intensity of competition among existing players in the market.
   - **Key Factors to Consider**:
     - Number of competitors and market share distribution.
     - Growth rate of the industry.
     - Product differentiation (how unique are the offerings?).
   - **Examples**:
     - **High Rivalry**: The fast-food industry, with many players competing for market share.
     - **Low Rivalry**: Niche industries with few competitors, like luxury yachts.

## **How to Use Porter’s Five Forces**
1. **Identify Forces**: Evaluate each of the five forces in your industry.
2. **Assess Strength**: Determine whether each force is strong (threat) or weak (opportunity).
3. **Develop Strategy**: 
   - Minimize threats (e.g., by creating barriers to entry or improving customer loyalty).
   - Leverage opportunities (e.g., negotiating better supplier terms or differentiating your product).

|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Threat of New Entrants**          | High: Low barriers to entry, easy to open a coffee shop. |
